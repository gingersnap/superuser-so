As a SaaS founder, you're drowning in data. Page views, sign-ups, clicks, sessions—the list goes on. But which metrics actually matter?

After working with hundreds of early-stage SaaS companies, we've identified 5 core metrics that every founder should track from day one.

## 1. Activation Rate

**What it is:** The percentage of users who reach your "aha moment"—that critical point where they experience real value from your product.

**Why it matters:** A user who signs up but never activates will churn. Focus on getting users to that first win as quickly as possible.

**How to track it:** Define your activation milestone (e.g., "created first project" or "invited a team member") and measure what percentage of new users reach it within their first week.

## 2. Weekly Active Users (WAU)

**What it is:** The number of unique users who engage with your product each week.

**Why it matters:** Growth in WAU shows that users find ongoing value in your product. Stagnant WAU means you have a retention problem.

**How to track it:** Define what "active" means for your product (e.g., logged in and completed an action) and count unique users each week.

## 3. Customer Churn Rate

**What it is:** The percentage of customers who cancel their subscription each month.

**Why it matters:** High churn means users aren't finding lasting value. For SaaS, monthly churn above 5-7% is a red flag.

**How to track it:** (Customers at start of month - Customers at end of month) / Customers at start of month × 100

## 4. Time to Value

**What it is:** How long it takes a new user to reach their first success with your product.

**Why it matters:** The faster users see value, the more likely they are to stick around and become paying customers.

**How to track it:** Measure the time between signup and your activation milestone. Look for ways to reduce this time.

## 5. Feature Adoption Rate

**What it is:** The percentage of users actively using specific features.

**Why it matters:** Low adoption of key features might mean they're hard to discover or don't solve real problems. High adoption validates your roadmap.

**How to track it:** For each major feature, calculate: (Users who used feature in last 30 days) / (Total active users) × 100

## Focus on What Matters

The key isn't tracking every possible metric—it's tracking the *right* metrics and actually acting on what they tell you.

Start with these five. Set up weekly check-ins to review them. When something changes, dig in to understand why.

That's how you build a data-informed (not data-overwhelmed) SaaS business.

When we started building SaaS products as solopreneurs, we quickly ran into a frustrating problem: the tools we needed to understand and support our users cost more than we were making.

## The Problem with Existing Tools

Analytics platforms like PostHog are incredible, but they come with complexity and pricing that assumes you have a dedicated data team. Customer messaging tools like Intercom are powerful, but their pricing starts at hundreds of dollars per monthâ€”before you've even validated your product-market fit.

Worse, these tools don't talk to each other. You're paying for two separate platforms, manually connecting the dots between what users *do* in your analytics and what they *say* in your support inbox.

## Our Solution

We built Superuser to solve this exact problem. By combining analytics and customer support in one platform, we can:

- **Show you the full picture**: When a user asks for help, see exactly what they did in your app beforehand
- **Trigger smart messages**: Send onboarding tips based on actual user behavior, not guesswork
- **Save you money**: One affordable subscription instead of two expensive ones

## Built for Small Teams

We designed Superuser specifically for solopreneurs and small SaaS teams. That means:

- **Simple pricing** that scales with you, not against you
- **Easy setup** that takes minutes, not days
- **Powerful features** without overwhelming complexity

## What's Next

We're just getting started. In the coming months, we'll be adding:

- More integrations with popular tools
- Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis
- AI-powered support suggestions
- And much more based on your feedback

If you're tired of juggling expensive tools that don't work together, we'd love for you to [give Superuser a try](/).
